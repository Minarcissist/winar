### colormat

![colormat](1.%20aseprite/sprites/colormat.png)

colormat consists of 2 layers, `deck` & `keel`

### how we did the drawing?

![gif-preview-winar](1.%20aseprite/sprites/gif-preview-winar.gif)

deck
* take 2 `6block` pillars beside each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
* take 5 `3block` pillars beside each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the top
* take 1 `3blockCorner` and place it beside the 3block stack
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the top

the distance between the deck & the keel = `2pixel` unit

keel
* lay down a `3block` pillar horizontally & in line with 2nd `6block` pillar
* stack 6 on top of each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the right

### colormat

![colormat](2.%20illustrator/sprites/colormat.webp)

colormat is divided into 2 groups, the deck & keel

deck:

![colormat-deck](2.%20illustrator/sprites/colormat-deck.webp)

* take 2 `6block` pillars beside each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
* take 5 `3block` pillars beside each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the top
* take 1 `3blockCorner` and place it beside the 3block stack
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the top

keel:

![colormat-keel](2.%20illustrator/sprites/colormat-keel.webp)

* lay down a `3block` pillar horizontally & in line with 2nd `6block` pillar
* stack 6 on top of each other like an increasing high line chart ðŸ“ˆ
  > it is important to note that it should be aligned from the bottom with a 1 pixel gap to the right

the distance between the deck & the keel = `2pixel` unit

### rainbowmat

![rainbowmat](2.%20illustrator/sprites/rainbowmat.webp)

rainbowmat purpose:
* better view of individual squares
* better view of tracing

### cutmat

![cutmat](2.%20illustrator/sprites/cutmat.webp)

* select the outside edge squares
* cut the corner points of each squares turning them into a right-angled triangle

notice how at [how we did the drawing](#how-we-did-the-drawing), it was mentioned that "the distance between the deck & the keel = `2pixel` unit", but here we did nothing but joined the deck & keel

once done, the logo should have a tracing like this below;
